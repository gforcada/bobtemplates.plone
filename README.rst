==========================
Plone templates for mr.bob
==========================

This distribution contains some templates to use with `mr.bob
<http://mrbob.readthedocs.org>`_.


Templates
=========

The primary focus is creating the most basic templates, so a basic distribution
template, a buildout template and a theme distribution (roughly in that order)
will be the ones you will find here.

Currently working on:

* basic_plone

In the future (contributions welcome):

* plone_buildout
* plone_theme


Code and contributions
======================

Code is hosted on a `github <https://github.com/gforcada/bobtemplates.plone>`_
repository, so fork away and make pull requests to improve it.

Contributions, with patches and/or suggestions, are always welcome.


Code conventions
================

Being picky as I am, everything code on the distribution and generated by the
templates should pass pep8, pyflakes, contain no superfluous spaces and any
tab at all anywhere. Life is better when it's free from distractions.
