Plone templates for mr.bob
==========================

This distribution contains some templates to use with `mr.bob
<http://mrbob.readthedocs.org>`_.


Templates
=========

The primary focus is creating a small set of high quality templates for plone
development. The first ones on the list are:

* basic distribution template (a two namespaces distribution).
* buildout template (with all the bells and whistles for development and
  testing.
* diazo theme template.


plone_basic
-----------

* Creates the distribution folder structure
* profiles folder and files within it
* Fill setup.py

What's missing:

* finishing setup.py
* browser folder with sample view
* interfaces.py
* testing.py and tests folder
* general configure.zcml
* locales folder
* top level docs folder (sphinx)
* upgrades.zcml and upgrades.py
* minimal buildout (?)
* travis-ci (?) related files


plone_buildout
--------------

Not even started, contributions welcome.


plone_theme
-----------

Same here as `plone_buildout`, contributions welcome.


Code and contributions
======================

Code is hosted on a `github <https://github.com/gforcada/bobtemplates.plone>`_
repository, so fork away and make pull requests to improve it.

Contributions, with patches and/or suggestions, are always welcome.


Code conventions
================

Being picky as I am, everything code on the distribution and generated by the
templates should pass pep8, pyflakes, contain no superfluous spaces and any
tab at all anywhere. Life is better when it's free from distractions.
